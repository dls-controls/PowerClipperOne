Log of Modifying Motor 1 JogSpeed

Started Off with 4mm/millsec

This I122 equivalent value can be seen in:
(1) Velocity Limits GUI in mm/sec as 'Jog Command Velocity Magnitude'
(2) the local project file System/Motors/Motor1.msetup XML as <BasicMotion><JogSpeed>4</JogSpeed>
(3) the local project file Configuration/systemsetup.cfg INI as Motor[1].JogSpeed=4
(4) the remote project file systemsetup.cfg in /opt/ppmac/Project/Configuration/systemsetup.cfg
(5) from the terminal by querying 'I122' or 'Motor[1].JogSpeed'

All locations except the GUI use mm/millsec units, GUI uses mm/sec

All the above show it as 4 (or 4000)
